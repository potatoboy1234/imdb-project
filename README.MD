This is a Data Analytics proejct that had one question in mind at start, and later collected a lot more in the process. Some questions weren't answered (yet?).

The goal of this project was to find out whetehr comedy movies were better before. If we're using average rating as a measurement of being good or bad, then IMDb's dataset seems to suggest that comedy movies were indeed better before.

Potential biases could include:

* Newer movies typically get more ratings, as they're viewed at the point in time when rating a movie online is already possible.
* Older movies could receive higher ratings due to nostalgia-related reasons.
* Older movies that are still known today are likely good enough movies to stay relevant through the years.
* Comedy is a highly subjective genre, and what was considered a good laugh 40-50 years ago could have a different reaction today.
* Personal bias: I haven't seen that many newer comedy movies that I genuinely thought were very good.
* IMDb's dataset labels movies with multiple different genres, but people rate movies only once, and not for each individual genre. 

I have learned a lot during this project, but some questions are still unanswered:

* What are the combinations of genres that will get the highest average rating?
* What are the types of titles that seem to get a higehr average rating? 
* Who contributes to a rating more: the director or the actors? Or could it be the crew?
